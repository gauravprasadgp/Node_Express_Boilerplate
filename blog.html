		<h2>Superior Web Design Represents Your Company and Grows Your Business</h2>
		<p>Creating a digital presence doesn’t mean simply building a website and waiting for customers to approach your brand. Your website is your company’s online foundation. It serves as your primary customer touchpoint and conversion machine. As such, you must ensure it ranks high in search engines, stands out from the competition and relates to your visitors' intentions.
		
		Statistics reveal that website design and navigation influence 94 percent of first impressions. Search engines also favor websites with responsive web design and well-structured web content. What’s more, 75 percent of site credibility comes from web page design.
		
		As a business owner, it is critical that you maintain a responsive website design to appeal to search engines and online users.
