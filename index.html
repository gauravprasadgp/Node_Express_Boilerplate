          <h2>Robust Web Design</h2>
          <p>
            In today’s digital world, it is crucial to stay connected with your
            customers and prospects to leverage new markets and expand your
            business. Statistics show that approximately 4.57 billion people
            worldwide are active internet users, comprising 59 percent of the
            global population. Within this online community, 53 percent perform
            research before connecting with a brand to ensure they are making
            the right decision. A study from Episerver also found that 92
            percent of consumers visit a brand’s website with multiple
            intentions other than buying. These include product/service
            research, comparison shopping and business review. This data proves
            consumers do not purchase on impulse.

          <h2>Grows Your Business</h2>
          <p>
            Creating a digital presence doesn’t mean simply building a website
            and waiting for customers to approach your brand. Your website is
            your company’s online foundation. It serves as your primary customer
            touchpoint and conversion machine. As such, you must ensure it ranks
            high in search engines, stands out from the competition and relates
            to your visitors' intentions. Statistics reveal that website design
            and navigation influence 94 percent of first impressions. Search
            engines also favor websites with responsive web design and
            well-structured web content. What’s more, 75 percent of site
            credibility comes from web page design. As a business owner, it is
            critical that you maintain a responsive website design to appeal to
            search engines and online users. You must ensure your target
            customers see a legit business platform when they search for your
            company online. Otherwise, you risk losing trust from your
            prospective clients and dissuade them from engaging with your brand.
            Invest in responsive website design and build trust and confidence
            in your brand offerings. Our website design company provides
            SEO-friendly web design services that aim to boost your search
            rankings, increase your online exposure and convert page visitors
            into paying customers.
